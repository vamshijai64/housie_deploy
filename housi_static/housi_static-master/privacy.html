                        <h5>Use of Cookies:</h5>
                        <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Portal for our Users, we use "cookies", or such
                            similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a
                            User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified
                            computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration),
                            DreamHousie has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's
                            computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A
                            cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. DreamHousie’s advertisers may also assign their
                            own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that
                            DreamHousie does not control. DreamHousie's web servers automatically collect limited information
                            about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits
                            the Portal. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where
                            to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does
                            not identify the User personally. DreamHousie uses this information to deliver its web pages to
                            Users upon request, to tailor its Portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the
                            Portal and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where DreamHousie's visitors come.</p>

                            privacy policies, which are beyond DreamHousie's control. Once the User leaves DreamHousie's
                            servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's
                            browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the
                            operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from DreamHousie's own. If the
                            User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User
                            may contact the site directly for more information. DreamHousie is not responsible for the privacy
