                                                The Caller/Dealer calls the randomly generated number/cue one at a Time.
                                                Pay proper attention to the numbers that are being called. A General
                                                Knowledge question(s) with two options displayed on your screen you have
                                                to choose the correct answer. If the answer choose by you is correct
                                                then you will be Eligible to mark the number on your Ticket(s) If the
                                                answer you choose is
                                                wrong the question pop-up won’t close and you cannot able to mark the
                                                number on your Ticket(s) until the next question answered by you is
                                                correct. If the number called by Caller appears on your Ticket(s), Tap
                                                on the number to mark it. Carefully keep track of the called numbers
                                                that are on your Ticket(s). Similarly, all other players mark off the
                                                numbers on their Tickets as the numbers are called by the Caller. The
                                                winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers of a winning
                                                combination(s). A player can have more than one winning combination(s)
                                                on a Single Ticket. If a particular winning combination has been
                                                successfully claimed, it cannot be claimed again unless the Particular
                                                Game(s)/Tournament(s) allows Multiple Claims.

                                                Step 5: Claiming the Winning Combination
                                                As soon as, you have marked of the numbers of a winning combination(s) on your Ticket(s), press the
Combination(s) button to claim your Winning(s).Winners decided basis on Time submitted for
combination(s). If the winning combination claimed by you is correct and fastest basis on Time, you
will get the winning amount(s).
In DreamHousie it is very important to claim the winning combination immediately before the next
number is called by the dealer. If a player hesitates or delays to claim they will lose the chance to
win the combination(s).Once a player made a successful claim(s) for a combination(s) The
combination(s) Button will Disable in all other players Ticket(s).

                                                Multiple Claims
                                                We want to give everyone a chance to win something in the game. Keeping that in mind, we offer
multiple claims in our Game(s)/Tournament(s). In other words, in Game(s)/Tournament(s) with a
large number of players, there can be multiple claim(s) made on a victory condition basis on Time
submitted for combination(s). For example, if someone claimed a Fast 5, someone else can also
make a Fast 5 claim(s) as all other combination(s). Once a player made a successful claim for a
combination(s) The combination Button will still be Enable for all other players until the Total prizes
announced for that combination(s) is claimed successfully Example Fast 5 (100/100). And so for all
other combination(s).

                                                Step 6: Winning Combinations
                                                The winning combinations on DreamHousie Tickets are:
1. FAST 5. The Ticket(s) that is first to have any 5 called Numbers.
